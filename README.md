This is a searchable blogging site, it needs a MongoDB database to work


clone the repo from GIT

navigate to the directory in your terminal and run:

$ NPM install

You'll need MongoDB installed, then:

run $ mongod from another tab in the terminal

back in the first tab, after the Node packages have been installed:
run $ gulp

If that all works then you should be able to:

Open browser and navigate to `http//:localhost:3000`
